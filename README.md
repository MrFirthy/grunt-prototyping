# grunt-prototyping
A grunt project for rapid prototyping, using serve, less watch, and live reload.


PLEASE NOTE: This project is based on Tangent Snowball's house styles repo which you can find HERE. The project uses LESS as it's pre-processor of choice. If you would like to remove this (or switch to SASS/Stylus), simply update the Grunfile accordingly.

`npm install -g grunt-cli`

run `grunt`  

Once running, it will automatically open a tab in your default browser, and from this point on, changing any LESS, JS, or HTML files will results in:  

recompiling and compressing of styles
